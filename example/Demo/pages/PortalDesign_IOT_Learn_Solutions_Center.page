                <h3 class="contentSpacing">Summary</h3>
                <p>Your retail customers can drive a new customer experience around mobile commerce with secure point-of-sale systems. Integrate solutions at scale to mobilize business for your customers, while helping to drive efficiencies and meeting market demands.</p>
                
                <h3 class="contentSpacing">Solution Recommendation</h3>
                <p><strong>Hardware:</strong> Mobilize your customers by upgrading stationary terminals to tablets. Ensure tablets are used properly with a mobile device management (MDM) to help limit unwanted functionality. For Android and Windows, also consider a specific launcher or image. A wide selection of AT&amp;T tablets are available and specifications can be viewed <a href="https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/devices/tablets.html" target="_blank">online</a>. Devices can be purchased via the Phoenix&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> or Premier platforms.</p>
                <p><strong>Software:</strong> Offer point-of-sale applications with dedicated accessories for credit card or NFC payments. These are available across all major tablet operating systems. Find the right one based on customer industry and operating system.</p>
                <p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Provide a more secure and mobile design than Wi-Fi alone with cellular connectivity. To ensure data traffic is private and goes where you and your end customer want, design a Access Point Name (APN). AT&amp;T Control Center, powered by Cisco Jasper, provides a robust connectivity platform for management and provisioning.</p>

                <p class="mt-10 mb-40">Your retail customers can drive a new customer experience around mobile commerce with secure point-of-sale systems. Integrate solutions at scale to mobilize business for your customers, while helping to drive efficiencies and meeting market demands.</p>
                
                <h4>Solution Recommendation</h4>
                <p class="mt-10"><strong>Hardware:</strong> Mobilize your customers by upgrading stationary terminals to tablets. Ensure tablets are used properly with a Mobile Device Management (MDM) service to help limit unwanted functionality. For Android and Windows, also consider a specific launcher or image. A wide selection of AT&amp;T tablets are available and specifications can be <a href="https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/devices/tablets.html" target="_blank">viewed online</a>. Devices can be purchased via the Phoenix<sup>3</sup> or Premier platforms.</p>
                <p><strong>Software:</strong> Offer point-of-sale applications with dedicated accessories for credit card or NFC payments. These are available across all major tablet operating systems. Find the right one based on customer industry and operating system.</p>
                <p class="mb-40"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Provide a more secure and mobile design than Wi-Fi alone with cellular connectivity. To ensure data traffic is private and goes where you and your end customer want, design an Access Point Name (APN). AT&amp;T Control Center, powered by Cisco Jasper, provides a robust connectivity platform for management and provisioning.</p>

                    <h4>Solution Recommendation</h4>
                    <p class="mt-10"><strong>Hardware:</strong> Make the most of routers designed for small business applications. Many already have options for a cellular modem and a bridge router to provide wireless backup. A wide selection of AT&amp;T certified wireless routers are available. Newer models with LTE&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> bands 2, 4, 5 and 17 will provide access to the nationwide LTE footprint.</p>
                    <p><strong>Software:</strong> Provide monitoring and command tools by utilizing remote cloud-based management platforms that are available to layer on top of any point-of-sale application.</p>
                    <p class="mb-40"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Set automated rate plan changes, and notifications to control any spikes in usage with AT&amp;T Control Center, powered by Cisco Jasper. The amount of data traffic over the cellular connection may vary greatly depending upon the business and the consistency of the primary connection. For connectivity into a data center, plans can be set to route data traffic to your data center.</p>
