            <br/>
            <h3>Customer site preparation requirements</h3>
            <p>AT&amp;T Partner Exchange&#8480; provides a smooth installation experience. We do all we can to install the service on time and in a quality manner. Close coordination and effective communication between AT&amp;T and the Solution Provider ensures that the Ethernet service is available when needed. Site readiness is essential for delivery of service. Delays in site readiness are a leading cause of installation setbacks. This document lists important requirements that will prevent any service installation delays. Key to this coordination is to be certain that the Local Customer Contact is knowledgeable and empowered regarding all decisions listed below. </p>
            <h3>Local contact:</h3>
            <p>The party ordering service from AT&amp;T (Solution Provider) must provide a Local Contact (LCON), including name, email address, and phone number. An AT&amp;T representative or Access Provider Engineering Representative may need to speak with the LCON regarding scheduling, building access, and problem resolution. An AT&amp;T or other Access Provider Engineering Representative will contact the LCON to schedule a site visit.</p>
            <p>The LCON must:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Be familiar with the location where service has been requested.</li>
                <li>Have decision-making ability to address the requested service requirements.</li>
                <li>Have the authority to confirm the ready date for all requirements that are the Solution Provider&#39;s responsibility.</li>
                <li>Be present on site for the site visit and prepared to discuss all of the following requirements with the  AT&amp;T or other Access Provider Engineering Representative. </li>
                <li>Be responsible for negotiating the establishment of an optical Demarcation Point with the property owner for multi-tenant buildings.</li>
                <li>Disclose any of the following before the project begins: 
                    <ul class="dash">
                        <li>Building access information such as parking, unloading zones, elevators, and route-to- work  area </li>
                        <li>Any noise or time restrictions</li>
                        <li>Any asbestos or hazardous materials present in the work area</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Solution Provider ensures a safe work environment and that all requirements have been met or will be completed by the agreed date. The Solution Provider will be prepared and have appropriate staff designated to test and accept service on due dates.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Site preparation delays</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>AT&amp;T schedules all parties to enable service completion as close as possible to the Solution Provider&#39;s desired date. However, any changes to plans or any delays associated with site preparation can affect the service delivery date. For example, a two-week delay in making conduit available can delay the overall installation date by two weeks for that site. The actual delay could be greater than two weeks depending on the lead time associated with scheduling work.</li> 
                <li>The Solution Provider must have the site ready by the committed ready date to avoid any delays in providing the requested service. If delays are anticipated, the Solution Provider should contact the Partner Exchange as soon as problems arise so we can reschedule our work forces.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>What to expect during the site visit</h3>
            <p>To facilitate a successful site survey, please review the following guidelines:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Ensure the LCON is on site to assist the AT&amp;T or other Access Provider Engineering Representative. The LCON should escort the engineer through the site survey and be responsible for noting the site requirements because the engineer may not provide written documentation.</li> 
                <li>It&#39;s advisable that the LCON note the engineer&#39;s name and number in the event assistance is needed in preparing the site.</li>
                <li>After the LCON and the engineer complete the site survey, they must immediately address all site requirements, or the order may face delays. During the site visit, the Solution Provider must advise the Partner Exchange and the design engineer when site completion is expected so AT&amp;T can give the Access Provider an accurate Estimated Completion Date (ECD). </li>
                <li>After the Solution Provider has completed all needed site requirement issues identified during the site visit, they must notify AT&amp;T when the work is complete. The engineer usually revisits the site to verify satisfactory work completion or to determine whether the site requires additional work.</li>
                <li>The AT&amp;T engineer works only with the Access portion of the order. Since Access is just one component of the service, direct all queries regarding order status to the Partner Exchange.</li>
                <li>The extension of wiring beyond the Minimum Point of Entry (MPOE) is the responsibility of the Solution Provider. Options regarding this requirement can be discussed further with the Partner Exchange operations team as needed.</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>The following information includes a list of general requirements associated with installing fiber optic-based services. The AT&amp;T or Access Provider Engineering Representative identifies actual requirements for specific installation during the site visit.</p>
            <p>Typically, five basic areas of obligation are needed to facilitate timely equipment installation and delivery of service:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Path </li>
                <li>Space </li>
                <li>Environmental </li>
                <li>Power </li>
                <li>Ground </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Path</h3>
            <p>The Solution Provider ensures that the conduit is available. A clear underground or aerial path is required from the property line where AT&amp;T facilities exist, to the telephone equipment room to support the entrance fiber. </p>
            <p>Optical Services are connected normally from the property line to the building&#39;s MPOE via an underground conduit facility. All conduits on the building&#39;s property are subscriber conduit and are the responsibility of the property owner to maintain and repair. Site installation work cannot begin until space within an acceptable conduit has been established between the property line and the Demarcation Point (DP).</p>
            <p>Outside (from the property line to MPOE):</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Minimum 2” conduit with a pull rope from the property line to the point of entrance. A 4” conduit is recommended, and 4” conduit – schedule 40 is required in some regions (for example, AT&amp;T Southern New England Telephone (SNET), and AT&amp;T West for new constructions). The size of the conduit is dependent on the future growth of the end customer. AT&amp;T shall place inner duct/fiber liner within this section. </li>
                <li>Minimum 3&#39; sweeping radius – no right angles – no more than three 90-degree angles without a pull box. Dimensions for pull box space – 12” x 12” x 18”. </li>
                <li>Paths longer than 300&#39; or with two or more 90-degree turns will require a pull box (12”x12”X18” minimum).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Inside (MPOE to Optical DP): </p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>The Solution Provider is responsible for the extension of wiring beyond the (MPOE). Options regarding this requirement should be discussed further with the Partner Exchange operations team as special construction charges may apply. </li>
                <li>A clear path with conduit or cable tray needs to be provided from the building point of entrance to the Demarcation Point where the equipment will be placed (if not at MPOE). </li>
                <li>If the Optical Demarcation Point is not the MPOE, the Solution Provider is responsible for providing the path between the MPOE and the proposed location. The conduit shall be a minimum 2” EMT type with a hard plastic corrugated inner duct with pull rope through which the fiber will be placed. </li>
                <li>Share this information with the electrical contractor. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>  
            <h3>Floor space and environmental requirements </h3>
            <p>As a standard, fiber transport equipment is placed in a common area with access to the entire building. It is the tenant&#39;s responsibility to obtain the necessary permissions from the building owner for use of the common area.</p>
            <p>Equipment racks, floor space and/or plywood backboards may be required. </p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Wall-mounted installation is recommended based on the small size of most network-terminating equipment (Example A). If the end customer prefers the equipment to be floor rack mounted, the first preference is to use a provided rack. The rack must be of suitable strength and quality for the site earthquake risk factor. It also needs to support the intended equipment weight and must be installed in a method that meets minimum standards for secure operation. The choice for equipment placement should be decided before the order is placed and be subject to confirmation following a site visit by an authorized AT&amp;T engineer. </li>
                <li>AT&amp;T supports the needs of the end customer to maximize floor/rack space. In cases where requests to deploy equipment for different types of AT&amp;T services within the same rack, the following caveats shall apply: </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rack quality/installation: </p>
            <p>AT&amp;T engineer confirms: </p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>A minimum of 36&quot; space is available in the front and rear of the rack, as per building code requirements.</li>
                <li>The rack is securely mounted and braced by bolting to the building floor (raised access floor panel, not the building floor); the rack is secured to adjacent frames in lineup to prevent impact between frames.</li>
                <li>The rack meets minimum standards for quality and sufficiently bears the expected weight of the equipment, including bracing shelves, if necessary.</li> 
                <li>Equipment is placed in the lower half of the frame with the heaviest equipment at the lowest location.</li>
                <li>If the rack is aluminum, stiffening aluminum blank plates at least 12” high are secured to the frame uprights to strengthen the frame. The stiffening plate should be located mid-height of the frame.</li>
                <li>19&quot; rack has upright opening a minimum of 17.80 inches to allow 19&quot; EIA width equipment to be mounted in rack.</li>
                <li>Rack is positively connected to common ground of all network equipment in building using at minimum #6 conductor and lug to rack.</li>
                <li>Mounting hardware, such as nut inserts for frame uprights, if required.</li>
                <li>The Solution Provider installs a cable-supporting structure (cable rack or a metallic EMT conduit) that meets the National Electric Code Standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Transport equipment varies from vendor to vendor, but the footprint and floor space requirements are approximately the same. Higher bandwidth equipment may require more than one bay or cabinet and different power requirements. An AT&amp;T or other Access Provider Engineering Representative will clarify if any variations are necessary when the type of equipment is determined. </li>
                <li>The equipment examples (Example B) depict minimum footprint requirements for fiber transport equipment systems with the approximate bandwidth capacity from 1 DS3 up to 12 DS3s.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>In addition to the space reflected on this drawing, AT&amp;T requires a 3&#39; clearance around the equipment for access. Discuss specific requirements with the AT&amp;T Engineer. </li>
                <li>The floor must be sturdy and able to withstand from 750 lbs. (without batteries) to 1,100 lbs. (with batteries), per bay of equipment. </li>
                <li>Operating environment should be between +40⁰ F and 100⁰ F at 20 to 50% relative humidity.</li>
                <li>Equipment location(s) for multiplexers and other electronic equipment must be clean, environmentally conditioned, and properly lit. </li>
                <li>With cabinet installations, if the floor is a raised computer floor, there must be no obstructions below the floor tiles. A small section of tile must be cut to allow for cable entry. </li>
                <li>Other regional specifications must be met as dictated by OSHA and local regulatory agencies (such as Earthquake Bracing). </li>
                <li>Individual consideration is given to the particular circumstances of space limitations. If, during the site visit, adequate common space isn&#39;t available, the Engineering Representative will discuss alternative arrangements to see whether the LCON can provide additional space in a common area. If no alternate common area is available, the AT&amp;T Engineer refers the issue to the AT&amp;T Ethernet Order Specialist. </li>
                <li>Support Structure – When equipment is to be placed in the center of a terminal room, an overhead ladder racking or under-floor cable tray from the wall to the fiber equipment must be provided. </li>
                <li>Wall Backboard – 4&#39; x 8&#39; x 3/4&quot; Fire-rated plywood fastened to studs. In some instances, a provided bay can be used in lieu of the wall backboard. This alternate arrangement must be discussed with AT&amp;T or the other Access Provider Engineering Representative at the site visit. </li>
                <li>New construction only: If the equipment is being placed during a period of new or scheduled construction, the AT&amp;T Engineer determines whether the location suits the initial site inspection. Following completion of construction and before placement of the Network Terminating Equipment (NTE), a final inspection is required to confirm site-readiness. Also note that before the installation of any AT&amp;T equipment, the room must be secured, including locks on doors.</li>

            <h3>Power</h3>
            <p>The Solution Provider ensures permanent, dedicated power for the equipment being installed. Power requirements can consist of nominal –48VDC, 110V, 125V, 220V, and so on – located within 6 feet of the AT&amp;T equipment. AT&amp;T may require more than one power outlet for some equipment types, and different equipment types require specific amperage. These items need to be discussed with the AT&amp;T Engineer to ensure that service can be provisioned on time. </p>
            <p>Equipment / Power Compatibility: </p>
            <p>AT&amp;T Engineer confirms: </p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Power supply for each device is adequate </li>
                <li>If the NTE is AC-powered, the cord must be physically separated from all signal cabling in the relay rack</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Ground</h3>
            <p>Relay racks/cabinets must be grounded by placing an exposed #6 or larger grounding wire to the building&#39;s ground source. This ground wire is attached to the closest ground rod (earth ground) or building bus bar available and run to the Network Terminating Equipment location in the room. In addition, the 110V, 15 amps AC outlet must be 3-prong and properly grounded. </p>
            <p>If the site is using a stand-alone, centralized bulk power plant (now or at any time in the future), then grounding is required as follows: #2 stranded ground is required from the earth electrode system to the equipment room. This ground would be connected to a grounding bus bar, or otherwise directly connected to different components. A #6 stranded ground is required from the grounding bus bar to the Network Terminating Equipment. </p>
            <p>If the site is not using a stand-alone, centralized bulk power plant (now or at any time in the future), and instead uses an embedded or integrated power configuration where the power plant is located within the same rack or cabinet as the equipment it powers, then grounding is required as follows:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>A #6 stranded ground is required from the earth electrode system to the equipment room. This ground should connect to a grounding bus bar, or otherwise directly connect to different components. </li>
                <li>A #6 stranded ground is required from the grounding bus bar to the network equipment. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Discuss specific requirements with the AT&amp;T or other Access Provider Engineering Representative at the time of the site visit.</p>
